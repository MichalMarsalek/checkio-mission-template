    <i>Over winter break of 2000-2001, I ran across Brainf*ck and other extraordinarily esoteric languages. As most students of programming do, I began searching for examples of these languages to help me learn. A great many examples were available, from a great many different authors, but I soon began to notice a pattern: these examples fell neatly into a few categories - 
    Hello, World!, 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall and Quines.<br>
    I created a language called HQ9+. HQ9+ is a very simple language consisting of four operations: H, Q, 9, and +. HQ9+ is very simple, but allows you to do some things that are very difficult in other languages.<br>

	Any other character is a syntax error which will to be tested here.<br>
	Your task is to program an interpreter for this language. You're given its source code in form of a string parameter and your function should output everything the program would have print to a standard output in form of a string.<br>
	Put newline character ("\n") between each output.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    <i>Interpreting one programming language in another is crucial for many languages, including Python.</i>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    <i>all(char in ("h", "q", "9", "+") for char in source_code)</i>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Hint:</strong>
    <i>The "+" instruction is a joke as is the language so don't worry about it to much. ;)</i>
